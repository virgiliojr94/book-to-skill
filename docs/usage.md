## 🚀 Usage

```
/book-to-skill <path-to-document-folder-or-glob>... [skill-name-slug]
```

Supported document formats: PDF, EPUB, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, HTML, RTF, MOBI/AZW/AZW3.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Process several files together into a unified skill
/book-to-skill ~/papers/paper1.pdf ~/notes/export.txt unified-research

# Process all supported files in a folder together
/book-to-skill ~/workspace/project-docs/ project-knowledge

# Process files matching a glob pattern
/book-to-skill "~/books/*.epub" my-library

# Update/fold new material into an existing skill folder
/book-to-skill ~/articles/new-paper.pdf ~/.claude/skills/project-knowledge
```

After the skill is created, use it like any other agent skill:

```bash
/designing-data-intensive-apps                  # load core mental models
/designing-data-intensive-apps replication      # find and explain a topic
/designing-data-intensive-apps ch05             # dive into chapter 5
/designing-data-intensive-apps "what chapters do you have?"
```

In GitHub Copilot CLI you may need to run `/skills reload` after the file is written so the new skill appears in `/skills list`. Claude Code and Amp pick it up on the next session.
