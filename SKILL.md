# Book-to-Skill Converter

Transform written knowledge into actionable agent skills by extracting structure — not producing summaries.

## Philosophy

Books contain crystallized expertise: frameworks, principles, and techniques that took years to develop. This skill extracts that knowledge into a format GitHub Copilot CLI, Amp, Claude Code, or another compatible agent can leverage repeatedly.

**Extract structure, not summaries.** A skill isn't a book report. It's a toolkit of:
- Named frameworks (mental models with clear application)
- Actionable principles (rules that guide decisions)
- Techniques (step-by-step methods)
- Anti-patterns (what to avoid and why)
- Voice calibration (how the author thinks and communicates)

**Preserve the author's precision.** Frameworks often have specific names for reasons. "The 5 Whys" isn't interchangeable with "ask why multiple times." Capture the exact formulation.

**Layer depth appropriately.** Simple books → simple skills. Complex books with 10+ frameworks → skills with reference files and on-demand chapters.

---

## Modes of Operation

Four paths available. Route based on what the user asks:

### 1. Full Conversion (Default)
**Trigger:** User provides one or more document/directory/glob paths without special instructions
**Action:** Run all steps below (Steps 0–9)
**Output:** Complete skill with SKILL.md, chapters/, glossary, patterns, cheatsheet

### 2. Analyze Only
**Trigger:** User says "analyze", "just extract", or "I want to review before generating"
**Action:** Run Steps 0–3, then produce a structured extraction report (frameworks, principles, techniques found). Stop — do NOT generate skill files.
**Output:** Analysis report for user review

### 3. Generate from Prior Analysis
**Trigger:** User has existing analysis notes or previously ran analyze-only
**Action:** Skip Steps 0–3, use the provided analysis as input, run Steps 4–9
**Output:** Skill files from the provided analysis

### 4. Update / Fold-in (Existing Skill)
**Trigger:** User provides one or more new source paths and indicates they want to update an existing skill (either by pointing to the existing skill folder, providing a skill slug that already exists in `SKILLS_HOME`, or explicitly requesting an update).
**Action:** Run Step 0 (out-of-scope check), Step 1 (validate inputs), Step 1.5 (identify book type), and Step 2 (extract new files). Then skip to Step 5 (identify/detect existing skill path) and run the **Update / Fold-in Workflow** to merge the new content into the existing skill files.
**Output:** Updated existing skill with new/revised chapter summaries and merged indexes/glossaries.

## Skill Locations

This converter can run from multiple skill systems. When looking for this converter's helper script or writing the generated book skill, prefer these locations in order:

1. GitHub Copilot CLI personal skills: `~/.copilot/skills/`
2. Cross-agent personal skills (Copilot, Amp, Codex): `~/.agents/skills/`
3. Claude Code personal skills: `~/.claude/skills/`
4. Project-local Copilot skills: `.github/skills/`
5. Project-local Claude skills: `.claude/skills/`
6. Project-local Amp / Copilot skills: `.agents/skills/`
7. Amp global skills: `~/.config/agents/skills/`
8. Amp legacy global skills: `~/.config/amp/skills/`

For **generated** book skills, pick a destination that the user's host agent can actually discover (see Step 5). When more than one valid root exists, ask the user once and remember the answer for the session — do not silently default.

---

## Step 0 — Out-of-scope check

If no arguments are provided, stop and respond:
> "book-to-skill requires a supported document path, folder, or glob pattern. Usage: `book-to-skill <path-to-document-folder-or-glob>... [skill-name-slug]`"

Throughout the workflow:
- Identify the input paths and the optional skill slug.
- If the last argument is not a file, folder, or glob that exists or matches any files, and it looks like a skill slug (e.g. lowercase hyphens, alphanumeric), treat it as `SKILL_NAME`.
- Treat all other arguments as the list of `INPUT_PATHS`.
- If any input path is an existing skill directory (contains `SKILL.md` and a `chapters/` sub-folder), or if `SKILL_NAME` matches an existing skill slug in `SKILLS_HOME`, flag this run as an **Update/Fold-in** operation (Mode 4).

---

## Step 1 — Validate input

Verify that there is at least one supported file, directory, or glob pattern among the `INPUT_PATHS`.
For directories and globs, expand them to find matching supported files (`.pdf`, `.epub`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, `.rst`, `.adoc`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.rtf`, `.mobi`, `.azw`, `.azw3`).

If no supported files are found, stop with a clear error message.

---

## Step 1.5 — Identify content type

Before extracting, ask the user:

> "What kind of content do these sources have? This helps me choose the best extraction method.
>
> 1. **Technical** — has code blocks, tables, formulas, diagrams (e.g. programming books, academic papers, architecture guides)
> 2. **Text-heavy** — mostly prose, few or no tables/code (e.g. management, productivity, narrative non-fiction)
> 3. **Not sure** — I'll use the fast method and warn you if quality seems limited"

Store the answer as `BOOK_TYPE`:
- Option 1 → `BOOK_TYPE=technical`
- Option 2 → `BOOK_TYPE=text`
- Option 3 → `BOOK_TYPE=text`

**If `BOOK_TYPE=technical`**, inform the user before proceeding:
> "📐 Technical mode selected — using Docling for structure-aware extraction (tables, code blocks, formulas preserved as markdown). This takes ~1.5s per page, so expect a few minutes for longer sources. Starting now…"

**If `BOOK_TYPE=text`**, inform:
> "📄 Text mode selected — using the fastest suitable extractor for each file type. Plain text/Markdown/HTML are usually ready in seconds; PDFs use pdftotext when available."

---

## Step 2 — Extract text from the source documents

Run the extraction script, passing the input paths:

```bash
SCRIPT_PATH=""
for candidate in \
  "$HOME/.copilot/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py" \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py" \
  "$HOME/.claude/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py" \
  ".github/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py" \
  ".claude/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py" \
  ".agents/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py" \
  "$HOME/.config/agents/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py" \
  "$HOME/.config/amp/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py"
do
  if [ -f "$candidate" ]; then
    SCRIPT_PATH="$candidate"
    break
  fi
done

if [ -z "$SCRIPT_PATH" ]; then
  echo "Could not find scripts/extract.py for book-to-skill" >&2
  exit 1
fi

PYTHON_BIN="${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}"
if ! command -v "$PYTHON_BIN" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  PYTHON_BIN="python"
fi

"$PYTHON_BIN" "$SCRIPT_PATH" $INPUT_PATHS --mode <BOOK_TYPE> --install-missing ask
```

Before extraction, the script checks optional Python packages needed for the detected format. If a better extractor is missing, it prompts the user with the available fallback. Non-interactive sessions default to fallback unless install mode is explicitly `yes`.

**Tip — preflight the environment:** run `"$PYTHON_BIN" "$SCRIPT_PATH" --check` to print a per-format report of which extractors are installed and the exact command to install whatever is missing, without processing any file. Useful when a user reports a setup or quality problem.

This creates:
- `<tempdir>/book_skill_work/full_text.txt` — combined extracted text of all sources with clear visually demarcated boundaries.
- `<tempdir>/book_skill_work/metadata.json` — overall combined size, words, pages, token counts, and a detailed list of individual processed `sources`.

Read `<tempdir>/book_skill_work/metadata.json` to inspect the results.

---

## Step 2.5 — Pre-flight cost estimate

Read `<tempdir>/book_skill_work/metadata.json` and present the user with an estimate **before doing any generation**:

```
📖 Sources detected: <total_sources> source(s)
<list each source filename and format from the sources metadata list>
📄 Combined Pages/Sections: ~<N> | Words: ~<N> | Total tokens: ~<N>K

💰 Estimated token cost (Full Conversion / Update):
   Input  (reading + prompts): ~<N>K tokens
   Output (skill files generated/updated):  ~<N>K tokens
   Total:                           ~<N>K tokens

   Cost: multiply the token counts above by your model's current
   input/output per-1M-token rates (prices and model names change often —
   do not hardcode them; quote today's rate and label it as an estimate).

   ⏱  Estimated time: ~<N> minutes

📁 Files to be generated/updated:
   SKILL.md + chapter files + glossary + patterns + cheatsheet

➡  Proceed with Full Conversion / Update? (or type "analyze only" to preview first)
```

**How to estimate:**
- Input tokens ≈ `estimated_tokens` from metadata × 1.3 (prompts overhead per chapter pass)
- Output tokens ≈ chapters × per-chapter budget + 4,000 (SKILL.md) + 4,500 (glossary + patterns + cheatsheet)
  - Per-chapter budget midpoint by `BOOK_TYPE` (DEPTH is decided later in Step 4 and can raise it): `text` ≈ 1,000, `technical` ≈ 1,800. If the user has already indicated reference-only vs deep study, use the matching row of the Step 7 matrix.
- Cost: report the token counts and multiply by the user's current per-1M-token input/output rates. Do NOT hardcode dollar figures — model names and prices change; if you show one, label it an estimate and date it.

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding. If they say "analyze only", switch to Mode 2.

---

## Step 2.6 — REPL-style access for large books (> 50k tokens)

Inspired by the Recursive Language Model (RLM) paradigm: treat `full_text.txt` as a queryable corpus, not a single read. Loading the whole file into context burns budget you will need later for generation.

For books over ~50k tokens, prefer programmatic probes over `Read(full_text.txt)` without bounds:

```bash
# Size check before any Read
wc -w "$FULL_TEXT_PATH"

# Find chapter offsets without loading the whole file
grep -n -E "^\s*(Chapter|CHAPTER)\s+[0-9]+" "$FULL_TEXT_PATH" | head -40

# Pull only the chapter you need (lines start..end inclusive)
sed -n '<start>,<end>p' "$FULL_TEXT_PATH"

# Verify a framework is actually mentioned before claiming it in SKILL.md
grep -c -i "westrum\|dora" "$FULL_TEXT_PATH"

# Targeted Read with offset/limit avoids dumping the full file
# Read(file_path=full_text.txt, offset=<line>, limit=<lines>)
```

Use this approach for Step 3 (structure analysis), Step 7 (per-chapter summaries), and Step 8 (glossary / patterns extraction). On books under 50k tokens, a single `Read` is fine.

Why this matters: a 200-page book is ~75k tokens. Re-reading it once per chapter (28 passes) costs ~2M input tokens; using grep + sed to pull only relevant slices keeps generation cost proportional to the output, not the source.

---

## Step 3 — Analyze book structure

Read the first 8,000 characters of the extracted `full_text.txt` to identify:
- Book **title** and **author(s)**
- **Chapter structure** (look for "Chapter N", "PART I", numbered headings, table of contents)
- **Core themes** and subject domain
- Approximate number of chapters

Then read the Table of Contents section if present to map all chapters.

**If mode is "Analyze Only":** produce the extraction report now and stop. Structure:
```
## Extraction Report — <Title>

### Author's Core Frameworks
- **<Framework Name>**: <what it is and when to apply>

### Key Principles
- <Principle>: <actionable rule>

### Techniques & Methods
- <Technique>: <step-by-step or how-to>

### Anti-patterns
- <What to avoid>: <why>

### Suggested Skill Name
`{author-lastname}-{core-concept}` — e.g. `cialdini-influence`

### Chapters Detected
| # | Title | Main Frameworks |
```

---

## Step 4 — Ask purpose (Full Conversion only)

Before generating, ask the user:

> "What should this skill help you do? (Pick one or more)
> 1. Apply the author's frameworks while working
> 2. Think with the author's mental models
> 3. Reference specific chapters and concepts
> 4. All of the above"

Use the answer to weight what gets highlighted in the SKILL.md Core section.

**Derive `DEPTH` from the answer (no extra prompt):**
- Answer is **only** option 3 (reference) → `DEPTH=reference` — lean, fast-lookup chapters.
- Answer includes option 1, 2, or 4 → `DEPTH=study` — deeper chapters with more worked detail, examples, and reasoning.

`DEPTH` and `BOOK_TYPE` together set the per-chapter token budget in Step 7. Do **not** ask a separate "study vs reference" question — it is inferred here. (In Modes 2/3, where Step 4 is skipped, default `DEPTH=study`.)

---

## Step 5 — Determine skill name

If `SKILL_NAME` was provided, use it as the skill slug.
Otherwise, propose two options and let the user choose:
- **By author-concept**: `{author-lastname}-{core-concept}` (e.g. `cialdini-influence`, `meadows-systems`)
- **By title**: lowercase hyphens from book title (e.g. `designing-data-intensive-apps`)

Default to author-concept format if the book has a strong methodological identity.

Choose the destination skill root (`SKILLS_HOME`). Probe the user's filesystem for existing skill homes and pick by **the host the user is running in**:

| Host agent | Personal skill root (probe in order) | Project-local root |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `~/.copilot/skills` → `~/.agents/skills` | `.github/skills` → `.claude/skills` → `.agents/skills` |
| **Amp** | `~/.agents/skills` → `~/.config/agents/skills` → `~/.config/amp/skills` | `.agents/skills` |
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills` | `.claude/skills` |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `~/.agents/skills` (discovered natively; follows symlinks) | `.agents/skills` |

Selection rules:
1. If **exactly one** of the host's candidate roots exists on disk, use it without asking.
2. If **none** exist (fresh machine), ask the user which root to create — present the host-appropriate options and remember the choice for the session. Do not silently pick.
3. If the user explicitly asked for project-local output, prefer the project-local row.
4. If you cannot identify the host, ask: "Which agent are you running this in — GitHub Copilot CLI, Amp, Codex, or Claude Code?"

Set `SKILLS_HOME` to the selected root and check if `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/` already exists.
If it does, prompt the user to choose:
1. **Update / Fold-in** (Mode 4) — integrate new files/content into the existing skill components.
2. **Overwrite** — delete and regenerate the skill from scratch.
3. **Rename** — append `-2` or use a different custom slug.

If the user selects **Update / Fold-in**, proceed immediately to the **Update / Fold-in Workflow** section in [GENERATION.md](GENERATION.md) (skipping Steps 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) — load that file now, since Mode 4 does not pass through Step 2.5.

---

## Step 6 — Create skill directory structure

```bash
mkdir -p "$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/chapters"
```

---

## Steps 7+ — Generation, publish, and Update/Fold-in

Chapter generation, supporting files, the master SKILL.md template, the
security scan, cleanup/report, optional GitHub publish, the Update/Fold-in
Workflow, and Quality Rules all live in **[GENERATION.md](GENERATION.md)**
— not needed until you're actually about to generate.

Load `GENERATION.md` at whichever of these happens first:
- Step 2.5's cost estimate is confirmed ("proceed"), or
- Mode 4 (Update/Fold-in) is active and you've reached Step 5's
  "proceed immediately to the Update/Fold-in Workflow" branch — Mode 4
  skips Step 2.5, so don't wait for that gate in this case (see Step 5
  above).

If the run aborts before either point (bad input, user declines, analyze-only
mode), `GENERATION.md` is never loaded.
